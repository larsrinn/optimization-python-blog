    "* Link einfÃ¼gen (see below)\n",
    "* Different approaches to create_instance => at least mention\n",
    "\n",
    "# Motivation\n",
    "The Pyomo-Documentation contains a [gallery](https://github.com/Pyomo/PyomoGallery/wiki), where the most popular introduction model to [GAMS](http://www.gams.com/) is rewritten using the Pyomo-package: [TRNSPRT](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/Pyomo/PyomoGallery/blob/master/transport/transport.ipynb). \n",
    "\n",
    "However, in the pyomo gallery the model is created as a concrete model. This means, all sets and parameters need to be defined in the model file. For most practical applications it is desirable to create an abstract model that can be initialized with varying data, in order to use the model for more purposes. I'm going to show how to create the transport model as an abstract model, initialize it with the data of the standard example and solve the problem. I suggest you look through the example in the pyomo gallery before reading this post, because I won't repeat the explanation of some interesting details.\n",
    "\n",
    "# The transport model\n",
    "The transport model is an optimization of the transport costs of one good. Production capacities of the plants must not be exceeded, while the demand at the markets must be met. The transport costs are linear with respect to the freight and the distance between a plant and a market. For a description of the transport model using mathematical terms see the example in the [pyomo gallery](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/Pyomo/PyomoGallery/blob/master/transport/transport.ipynb).\n",
    "\n",
    "In the original description of the model, as well as in the replication in the pyomo gallery, simple characters are used as designators for sets, parameters and variables. While this might the mathematical convention, I'm going to deviate from that approach and use descriptive names.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Implementation of the abstract model\n",
    "The examples in the Pyomo gallery always import everything from `pyomo.environ`. In this blog, I'll only import the objects, that are actually needed. Firstly it is a better programming habit, since it reduces the risk of namespace collisions. But also, the scripts for model generation run faster. For the application to real world problems the importing time will be neglible compared to the model generation and solving time. But for simple problems it actually makes a difference. \n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast to the example in the pyomo gallery, the model must be an object of the class `ConcreteModel`."
